This is my SlackBuilds directory. Find here various build scripts for
Slackware.

Update Feb. 3rd 2016
So that nobody will go over me, I want to leave clear here, those scripts are
taken from slackbuilds.org and are of their respective owner property. But in
some time modified by me, therefore not exactly equal as the ones you find on 
slackbuilds.org . Some of them ar adopted to be used to make a full build
of FreeCAD on slackware64-current right now, this is what will become
Slackware64-14.2 in a short period probably. 

I will see if I keep up this work and automate it, so we can simply run
a FreeCAD-build.sh and get out all of the needed packages and a FreeCAD 
installation on Slackware.

Enjoy
